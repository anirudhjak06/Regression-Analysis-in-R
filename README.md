# Regression-Analysis-in-R

## Project Name:
Regression Analysis for establishing a relation between response and regressor variables.

## Problem Statement
- We are given a life expectancy dataset. We need to find different subtaks such as
  - Correlational Analysis 
  - Linear Regression Analysis
  - Non-Linear Regression Analysis
  - Coefficient of Determination (R-Square)

## Problem Solution
- We use the knowledge of relational analysis in linear and non-linear regression and work upon the tasks given in the problem statement.
- Finally, we observe our experimental results and conclude them.

**For more details about the project please refer to [**"Project Report PPT.pdf"**][1]**

## Get Started

The below steps show how to get started with the code running!.
- We need to have R installed on our computer.
- Its better if R studio is also installed for easier code execution.
- The packages mentioned in the top of the code must be installed.
- The Life Expectancy Dataset must be installed for using/importing it.

By following these steps, the code will start executing smoothly without no errors.
